  <h1>To Tiffany, Vaishnavi, Arjah, and Karei</h1>
  <div class="message">
    You four are extraordinary.<br><br>

    Every single day, you get up and face the world with courage, kindness, and a work ethic that humbles us. You knock on doors for hours, through the heat, through the rain, through long days, with smiles on your faces and determination in your hearts. And somehow, after all that, you still find room to be thoughtful, sweet, and so genuinely giving.<br><br>

    You haven't just stayed in our home — you became a part of it.<br><br>

    Thank you for your kindness, your surprise gifts, your laughter, your energy, and the warmth you brought into our lives. The anniversary gift. The Father’s Day surprise. The flowers and cards. Every gesture, no matter how small, meant the world to us. <br><br>

    We couldn’t have asked for better people to host. This was our first time welcoming students into our home, and because of you, it became something we’ll treasure forever.<br><br>

    No matter where life takes you — remember this: You are loved. You are seen. You are deeply appreciated.<br><br>

    And you’ll always have a home with us.
